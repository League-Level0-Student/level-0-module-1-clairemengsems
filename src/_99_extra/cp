1. Fill in the blanks
______String______________ favoriteHobby = "programming";
________int____________ numberOfToes = 10;
_________int___________ degreesInARightAngle = 90;

_________int___________ myAge = ________11____________;
String _______Programmming Type_____________ = "Java";
double _________Pi___________ = 3.14159;



2. Initialize these variables...
    String whatIWantToBeWhenIGrowUp = "video game designer";
    int facebookFriends = 17;
    String myBirthday = "February 12, 2008";
    int sidesInATriangle = 3;
    
    
    
3. Declare and initialize variables for...
    ­ what you got for your birthday  
    String birthdayGift = "mouse";
    ­ the last meal you ate
    String lastMeal = "Bosco sticks and sauce";
    ­ what time you go to bed
    String bedTime = "9:30";
    
    
    
    
    
    
1. Complete the for loop below so that it prints out the numbers 1­10.
for( int i = 1 ;  i < 10           ;     i++        ){
print(i);
}
2. Complete the for loop below so that it counts down and prints out 75 to 50.
for(  int j =  75    ;    i > 50         ;     i--        ){
print(i);
}
3. Describe briefly what each part of the for loop does: 
for( a ; b ; c ){               } 
a) the a part creates a int variable
b) the b part makes it so when the variable is greater or lesser than a number, the loop stops.
c) the c part makes the variable greater or lesser by one every time the loop runs.



1. Declare a string variable and initialize it to “yes”. If the string is equal to yes, print “happy” otherwise print
“sad”. Then print "Wednesday".
What happens if you set the string variable to "no"? 

String mood = "yes"

if( mood == "yes" ){
print("happy");
}else{
print("sad");
}

if you set the string variable to no, it will print "sad" instead of "happy".

2. Declare an int variable to hold your age and initialize its value. If you are under 20, print “It’s so great being
young”, otherwise print “Don’t you wish you were young!”

int age = 11

if( age > 20 ){
print("Its so great to be young!");
}else{
print("Don't you wish you were young!");
}

3. Make an input pop­up to ask the user which animal they like. If the user types “dog”, print “Dogs go woof”,
otherwise if they type “cat”, print “Cats go meow” ....and so on with other animals. If you do not have code for
the animal they type, print “I don’t know that animal.”

String animal = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("What's your favorite animal?");

if( animal.equals ("dog")){
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Dogs go woof");
}
if(animal.equals ("cat")){
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Cats go meow");
}
if(animal.equals ("mouse")){
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Mice go squeak");
}if( animal.equal ("horse"))
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Horses go nieghhh");
	
}else{
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, " I don't know that animal);
}
